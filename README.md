### [<sub>â¬‡</sub> Greedy Cache](https://github.com/JustOff/greedy-cache/releases)

**Greedy Cache** is designed to force browser always load scripts, images and styles from cache. This reduces number of requests when reloading pages, improving overall load time (detailed report about other benefits of such behaviour can be found [here](https://code.facebook.com/posts/557147474482256). Additionally there is an option to enforce caching of images, even if origin server doesn't allow that.
